1.One way to be able to keep programs maintanable is to keep the program organized. When looking at my CRUD file, there is a read, update, and a delete section. 
The broken-up sections allowed it to be maintained and updated based on the needs of the program. For example, I changed the read from read one to read all. This was 
important to my program. The next way that I made it readable was by adding comments to the code. For example, what the widgets were, and what they did. This even 
described the graphs. This is important to maintaining the code in the future, and make the application more solid. In the future, the CRUD module can
be used to add more methods. This will help to better sort, organize, and update the data.
2. This assignment differed a little different than my other courses as I was creating the database all the way to the application. One of the things that I did to 
be able to help meet the requirements was seeing what the Galsgo Slavaire was wanting to see in the their application. As well as how they wanted to be able to sort the data.
This was almost like a user story. That I was able to take and make it to where they needed it. For example searching by different breeds as different breeds are
better than otheres for differnt types of search and rescue.
3.While a computer Scuentust uses technolgy to solve problems and prepare for the future, they also write and program software to create applications. Their primary foucs,
however is to validate and develop models for interation between people and computers or software and devices. The second part with the interaction is what is their main foucus and
very important. The work that I did one this project would allow them for more time to work on the interaction and the final product. This would take out the beginning steps
this would also all for the security to be added. This allows for the bigger items to be worked on next.
